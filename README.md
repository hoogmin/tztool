# TZTool: React.js/Next.js-based Time Zone Converter

A small project I chose to build to sharpen skills and for fun.
Time is more tricky for computers than at first glance. I am still in the
midst of working on this but most of the core functionality is here. I opted to
use momentjs for this project rather than dayjs (I was initially using dayjs). dayjs
wasn't the best fit for this use case, at least at the moment. Its timezone plugin still
needs work. When it improves, I may migrate this project over if there is ample reason.
